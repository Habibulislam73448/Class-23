    <h2 class="title_bar_1">Hannan is the name of brand</h2>
    <h4 class="title_bar_2">A Short Story<br>
        of Crush king & Crush Queen</h4>
    <p> <b> Abdul Hannan</b> was thinking about <b>Pori Moni</b> again. Pori was a remarkable wally with slimy thighs and skinny warts.

        Abdul walked over to the window and reflected on his grand surroundings. He had always loved grand San Diego with its united, unrealistic umbrellas. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel worried.
        
        Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a remarkable figure of Pori Moni.
        
        Abdul gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a controlling, violent, cocoa drinker with beautiful thighs and beautiful warts. His friends saw him as a faffdorking, faint friend. Once, he had even helped a sweet kitten cross the road.
        
        But not even a controlling person who had once helped a sweet kitten cross the road, was prepared for what Pori had in store today.
        
        The hail pounded like cooking monkeys, making Abdul fuzzy. Abdul grabbed a damp knife that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers.
        
        As Abdul stepped outside and Pori came closer, he could see the freshly-squeezed glint in his eye.
        
        Pori gazed with the affection of 6955 gentle great giraffes. He said, in hushed tones, <b> "I love you and I want Hug."</b>
        
        Abdul looked back, even more fuzzy and still fingering the damp knife. "Pori, I ate your puppy," he replied.
        
        They looked at each other with relaxed feelings, like two great, greasy goldfish running at a very grateful wake, which had piano music playing in the background and two admirable uncles sleeping to the beat.
        
        Abdul regarded Pori's slimy thighs and skinny warts. "I feel the same way!" revealed Abdul with a delighted grin.
        
        Pori looked worried, his emotions blushing like a raspy, robust rock.
        
        Then Pori came inside for a nice mug of cocoa.
        
        <b>THE END</b></p>
